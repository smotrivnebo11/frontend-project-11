## RSS reader

RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication, and itâ€™s is a simple, standardized content distribution method that can help you stay up-to-date with your favorite newscasts, blogs, websites, and social media channels. Instead of visiting sites to find new posts, find the RSS feed on a website and read new posts in an RSS reader.

## What Is an RSS Feed?

An RSS feed consolidates information sources in one place and provides updates when a site adds new content. You can add as many feeds as you like.

## How to use it?

1. Copy the URL of an RSS feed.
2. Paste the URL in the search box, click "Add"
3. Now you can see posts descriptions, follow links and read posts.
